** domain comparability
   - whether domain is arithmetic is currently used for deciding
     whether it's meaningful to compare a constant of this domain to
     constants of other domains.  But e.g. address and offset aren't
     comparable, but they are safe for arithmetic.  Similarly line and
     column--shouldn't be compared with one another, but are safe for
     arithmetics.  This is unlike named constants, which are not safe
     for arithmetic.

* TODO
** libzwerg C API
** vocabulary versioning
   Vocabularies need the same care as the C API when it comes to stability. Each
   vocabulary should actually come as a suite of versions that one can use, with
   one of them chosen as default (typically the latest one). Incompatible
   changes (e.g. introduction of a word that could clash with an existing
   variable, change of behavior, removal) would prompt version number bump, and
   one could request the old version explicitly.

*** 5
   Specify all vocabularies in external libraries, use libzwerg API. The current
   overload interface looks about right for what is necessary: yield once, maybe
   and many, and predicates, all keyed to a stack profile.

   Then "argv" can be in a vocabulary of its own, brought in by dwgrep, and
   primed with the arguments to actually yield.

   The problem with this is how to handle dependencies between vocabularies. E.g
   Dwarf vocabulary depends on core vocabulary's constant type (for all the
   builtin constants). How would one express this? Dp the vocabularies that can
   be built upon need to have a stable C API as well? (Well, they *would* be
   just libraries...).

** static analysis tools
*** overload pegging
    - We could use overload prototype declarations to mention return
      value type as well.  Then we could determine what overload will
      be chosen for each overloaded word, and dispatch it directly.

*** stack effect analysis
    - By the same token, we could statically determine that a certain
      program is invalid, because it underruns stack.  For variadic
      input argument operators (such as integrate, which is either
      ?T_DIE ->? ?T_DIE or ?T_DIE ?T_CLOSURE ->? ?()) we are possibly
      out of luck and have to fall back on runtime checking.

      - It might even make sense to turn off stack effect checking
        when we can prove that the program never underruns.

        We could also selectively turn off stack profile tracking for
        programs where we can statically determine all effects.  But
        that will be rare, any attribute access is a wild card.

      - At least stack shuffling operators need to be built in, so
        that we know that we don't lose type information after
        dup'ing.  (Without having to have something awfully generic
        like dup :: A => A A).

      - Variable binding somewhat complicates things, though we can
        probably simply annotate the deduced type in the scope.  Since
        variables are never redefined, this shouldn't be a big
        problem.

      - Closures are of course difficult.  No idea how to handle
        those.

*** strength reduction, of sorts
    - The idea is that instead of (Dw winfo (offset == 0x123)), we
      would emit (Dw 0x123 dwarf_offdie), without dwarf_offdie
      actually being a word.  (This would also check that there _is_
      such DIE in the first place.)  winfo would expose a "reduction
      point", and the translator would make use of that.

      - winfo, unit, child: offset, ?root, maybe pos
      - attribute: label
      - address/T_DIE: other range ?overlap, maybe pos
      - (r)elem/T_SEQ: pos
      - (r)elem/T_LOCLIST_ELEM: pos, maybe offset
      - value/T_LOCLIST_OP: pos

    - This functionality would depend on overload pegging, so that you
      know which overload to ask for abbreviations.  But some of it
      could be doable in runtime as well, and might still very much
      pay off.

*** removal of cloning for subexpression evaluation
    - If we can prove that the expression in a ?(), let, or [] doesn't
      touch existing stack slots at all, we can avoid cloning
      altogether.  E.g. the following rewrite:
      : let B := A child ?TAG_formal_parameter;
      : A child ?TAG_formal_parameter ->B;

    - In some other cases, it might be advantageous to just duplicate
      top element and drop in later.  E.g.:
      : let A := entry ?TAG_subprogram;
      : dup entry ?TAG_subprogram ->A;

      This would be likely especially advantageous if the "dup" just
      copies a shared pointer reference instead of cloning.

    - Or this:
      : entry ?([@AT_location] relem (pos == 0) label
      :         (?DW_OP_implicit_value, ?DW_OP_stack_value))
      ... which can be rewritten as:
      : entry [@AT_location] relem (pos == 0) label
      :       (?DW_OP_implicit_value, ?DW_OP_stack_value) drop

    - Simply converting unique_ptr's in stacks to shared_ptr's is not
      advantageous.  Even if we remove all the cloning (which is
      problematic, because of occasional set_pos calls), it's still
      slower than the original due to having to deal with all the
      reference counts.
      - thread unsafe shared_ptr might be better
      - can we avoid the reference counting altogether?

** Dictionaries
   - Maybe have a key-value value type?  And a => operator for
     constructing this?  The dictionary would then be:
     : [7 => 5, 8 => "foo"]
     There would be words, key and value, which access parts of the
     pair.  Lookup would be done like:
     : [dictionary] elem (key == 7) value	# gimme 7's value
     Querying:
     : [dictionary] (elem key == 7)		# do we have key 7?
     Getting list of all keys:
     : [dictionary] [|D| D elem key]
     Add 1 to key X:
     : [dictionary] [|D| D elem (key => value (==X) 1 add || )]
     Add A=>B unless A already present:
     : [dictionary] (|D| if (D elem key == A) then D else [D elem, A=>B])
     Wow, that's a mouthful.

     Um, what does this do?
     : [(1, 2, 3) => ("a", "b", "c")]
     I think it should be this:
     : [1 => "a", 1 => "b", 1 => "c", 2 => "a", ...]
     ... which actually shows that list of key-val pairs is no
     dictionary, or actually that it's a multi-set sort of thing.

** @AT_MIPS_linkage_name — translated to @AT_linkage_name automatically
** XXX @AT_stmt_list

   @AT_stmt_list yields a number of nodes of type line_table_entry.
   The following words (which are thin wrappers around similarly named
   libdw functions) are applicable to individual line table entries:

   : address
   : @lineop_index
   : @lineno (or @AT_decl_line ???)
   : @linecol (or @AT_decl_column ???)
   : @linebeginstatement, ?linebeginstatement, !linebeginstatement
   : @lineendsequence, ?lineendsequence, !lineendsequence
   : @lineblock, ?lineblock, !lineblock
   : @lineprologueend, ?lineprologueend, !lineprologueend
   : @lineepiloguebegin, ?lineepiloguebegin, !lineepiloguebegin
   : @lineisa
   : @linediscriminator

   The operators that return a boolean constant come also in assertion
   variant so that it's easy to filter interesting line table entries.

   XXX That's however not entirely consistent with how DW_FORM_flag*
   attributes behave.  For those, ?AT_* always means, is this
   attribute present, and never, is the value true.  Needs some more
   thinking to consolidate this.  Maybe we could abandon the @op's for
   these and just expose ?op's.  When ?x is present, it implies that
   @op is true.

** XXX .debug_frame, .eh_frame
   - do we need an overarching "theory" for both of these?
   - also, there's fair amount of tables around here (symbol tables,
     line tables, ...).  Does it make sense to understand them as
     first-class citizen of some sort?  Currently we understand there
     are values, every value has some properties, and some values have
     attributes.

** XXX multithreading
   - processing Dwarf has the potential for a lot of concurrency.  If
     locks end up serializing, we might actually open the Dwarf in
     each thread anew, and see if that helps.

** expose exception frames
** expose macros
    - one example query: who includes a given file?
** expose .debug_line
   - note missing DW_LNE_*, DW_LNS_*.  These can't quite have distinct
     domains, as they need to be comparable.  Better wait with
     implementing these until we get to line tables, so that it's
     better understood how these will need to be used.

** raw attributes
   - @AT_* should keep its current meaning of
     : attribute ?AT_* cooked value
     That seems more useful.
   - Raw access would have to be requested explicitly:
     : attribute ?AT_* raw value

** floats
   - These are currently represented as blocks.  libdw doesn't give us
     any support decoding these, and it seems to be not entirely
     trivial--endian issues, different encodings, and such.

     E.g. on x86_64, __float128 type claims to be 10 bytes, but the
     block is 16 bytes long.  long double claims to be 10 bytes as
     well, the block is 16 bytes as well, but aligned so that only the
     first ten bytes are used.

     Seems like a fair can of worms.  Is it worth it?

** proper decoding of DW_ATE_UTF
   - Decode as UTF-8?  Or do we need a wchar_t string?  Also, C++
     should have conversion facets for 16-bit and 32-bit character
     types, but that's not implemented in GCC yet.

** statistics?
   - akin to systemtap?  locstat would certainly use them.
   - but that might be overkill.  Maybe we just need reasonable
     dictionaries or something.

** location expression evaluation
   - could we use the program stack for this?

** address ranges vs. addresses, overloaded ?eq
   - address::T_DIE yields T_ASET, but address::T_ATTR yields T_CONST.
     Both should probably yield T_ASET, and T_ASET should be
     comparable to T_CONST.

** if/while condition in plain context
   - One can always force sub-expression evaluation by explicitly
     placing the condition into a ?() block.  This would however need
     a complementary word "until" so that it's possible to express a
     negative recurrent condition.

   - Hmm, actually while X do Y makes no sense in plain context.  When
     while finally stops iterating, it produces... nothing!  until is
     the only iteration tool that makes sense.

   - until ... do ... makes no sense either, from the linguistic
     perspective, as it would imply that the result of until feeds
     into the do block.

   - how about:

     : (!(address) parent)* address
     : until address do parent

     : entry merge* !(merge)
     : entry while merge do ()

     : (!AT_xyz integrate)* ?AT_xyz	# find closest DIE with DW_AT_xyz
     : while !AT_xyz do integrate

     : (!AT_xyz integrate)* attribute ?AT_xyz	# dwarf_attr_integrate
     : until (attribute ?AT_xyz) do integrate

     : (!AT_xyz integrate)* @AT_xyz	# value of integrated DW_AT_xyz
     : until @AT_xyz do integrate

     : let seq := {|B| (1 add (< B))* };
     : let seq := {|B| while (< B) do (1 add) };

     : ... ?(@AT_type ((?TAG_const_type, ?TAG_...) @AT_type)* ...
     : ... do @AT_type while (?TAG_const_type, ?TAG_...) ...

     : child*
     : while child take ()

   - Should while/until be plain context, which is useful, then
     if/unless should be as well.  Then perhaps let should be as well.
     Looking through let uses, that would be no expressivity loss.

   - Possibly allow other keywords besides "do".  "max" and "sum" come
     to mind.  "take" would produce every visited node (like what *
     does).  Could these somehow just be ordinary words?  Note that we
     don't need "collect", one can instead use "take" inside a
     capture.

     : [take ... while ...] 0 {@AT_* add} fold	# sum of selected nodes
     : [until ... take ...] {@AT_* max} fold1	# max of selected nodes

     : take B while C
     : loop:
     :   B yield
     :   (C || break)

     : do B while C
     : loop:
     :   B
     :   (C || (yield, break))

     : while C take B
     : loop:
     :   (C || break)
     :   B yield

     : while C do B
     : loop:
     :   (C || (yield, break))
     :   B

     : take B until C
     : loop:
     :   B yield
     :   (C break || )

     : do B until C
     : loop:
     :   B
     :   (C (yield, break) || )

     : until C take B
     : loop:
     :   (C break || )
     :   B yield

     : until C do B
     : loop:
     :   (C (yield, break) || )
     :   B

* weird ideas
** more general iteration
   - X* would be syntactic sugar for (X ^).  The ^ would reapply the
     whole expression that it's part of.  One could use it pretty much
     arbitrarily, e.g. (X ^ Y), (^ X), possibly even (X ^ Y ^ Z).
     It's unclear whether this is really useful, though achieving this
     by other means would be tedious to write.  But really, are there
     other uses apart from checking that, say, DW_MACRO_GNU_start_file
     and DW_MACRO_GNU_end_file are balanced?

     Details of operation are unclear as well.

   - We could also use a greedy star (or greedy variant of the above
     thing).  X& would be like X* !(X).

* undocumented functionality

** •“{” (“|” ID₁ ID₂ … “|”)? EXPR₁ “}” — blocks

    - {EXPR₁} -- A block syntax.  A value representing an expression
      EXPR₁ is pushed to TOS.  The enclosed expression can later be
      evaluated using an operator "apply".  Application causes EXPR₁
      to be evaluated in plain context.  Thus:
      : {add} 1 2 rot apply	# Leaves 3 on stack.
      : {1 add} 2 swap apply	# Likewise.

    - {|ID₁ ID₂ …| EXPR₁} -- A variant of block syntaxt with an
      identifier block.  When applied, pops TOS and binds it to the
      rightmost identifier, and then proceeds doing the same with
      other identifiers in right to left direction.

      : {|A B| A B add A B sub mul} 3 1 rot apply	# 8

    - When a block is applied, this introduces a new activation record
      (dynamic scope) inside the current scope.  Any let forms bind
      symbols in this new scope.  Upon creation, block literals copy
      values of referenced variables into their scope, so they work as
      closures:

      : let adder := {|x| {|y| x y add}};
      : 3 adder 2 swap apply	# 5

      : let map := {|L f| [L elem f]};
      : [1, 2, 3] {1 add} map	# [2, 3, 4]

    - Because blocks copy surrounding context instead of referencing
      it, all referenced bindings need to be defined at the point of
      block creation.  That precludes a simple way of writing
      recursive functions:

      : # This doesn't work:
      : let fact := {|N| if (N < 2) then 1 else (N 1 sub fact N mul)};

      Here "fact" is referenced inside the block, but at that point,
      it has not yet been defined, and such expression is thus
      erroneous.  It is possible to express recursion, even mutual
      recursion:

      : let f1 := {|N f1 f2|
      :    if (N < 100) then (
      :        N sub 1
      :        {f1} {f2} f2 apply	# recurse to f2
      :    ) else (N)
      : };
      :
      : let f2 := {|N f1 f2|
      :     if (N > 0) then (N mul: 2) else (N)
      :     {f1} {f2} f1 apply		# recurse to f1
      : };
      :
      : 5 {{f1}} {{f2}} f1	# 194

      ... but that is of course ridiculous.  The hope is that
      recursion is rarely useful in a language like this, which is
      meant for querying, not writing algorithms.  Should there be
      serious need for this sort of thing, this functionality would be
      introduced.

    - Example: stack shuffling operators.  (N.B.: this example uses
      underscores to distinguish from the corresponding built-in
      words.   Redefining built-ins is not allowed.)
      : let drop_ := {|a|};
      : let dup_ := {|a| a a};
      : let swap_ := {|a b| b a};
      : let rot_ := {|a b c| b c a};
      : let over_ := {|a b| a b a};

*** Infix operator overriding
   Infix operators are just reads, it would be straightforward to allow
   overriding them:

   : let ==~ = {?((|A B| ((A == B) || (A =~ B))))};
   : let !=~ = {!((|A B| ((A == B) || (A =~ B))))};

   The current codebase allows a limited form of this with the following let
   form:

   : let "===" := {something};

   But extending IdListOpt to allow both words and operators would be simple,
   and then all binding forms would allow this.

*** Stack profile-sensitive bindings

   : let elem/T_XYZ = {...};
   : let foo/T_XYZ = 1; # push value depending on TOS type :)

   Since symbol versioning should be built around overloads, and builtins
   themselves should be derived off that (at least I guess), allowing users to
   redefine particular overloads seems logical. Old syntax would stay around
   meaning that the profile selector is composed of 0 TOS slots.

**  (“while” | “until”) EXPR₀ “do” EXPR₁ | “do” EXPR₁ (“while” | “until”) EXPR₀

   - The "while..do" loop checks whether EXPR₀ yields anything.  If
     yes, it evaluates EXPR₁ and repeats; otherwise it doesn't do
     anything.

     "do..while" works similarly, but it first evaluates EXPR₁ and
     then tests whether EXPR₀ yields anything.

     "until" loops work similarly, but test a reverse condition.

   - EXPR₀ is evaluated in sub-expression context.
   - EXPR₁ shall have neutral stack effect.

** •“\dbg” — debug print

    Doesn't alter the stack in any way, but as a side effect prints
    some information about the computation in whose context it
    appeared.

** •colon infix syntax
    - When a word is followed by a colon, the following statement is
      executed before that word.  That can be used for writing the
      operators, where it makes sense, in infix form.  For example:
      : 10 add: 1	# equivalent to (10 1 add)
      : [10 range] sort: {a | if (a mod: 2 == 0) then 0 else 1}


* WORDS
** ·T_SEQ
***  at :: ?T_SEQ ?T_CONST -> ?()

     One can access a particular element by enumerating the array with
     elem or relem, and then do assertions on pos:

     : [some seq] elem (pos == 0)	# [0]
     : [some seq] relem (pos == 0)	# [-1]
     : [some seq] elem (pos != 0)	# [1:]
     : [some seq] elem (pos >= 3 && pos < 6)	# [3:6]
     : [some seq] relem (pos > 0)	# [:-1]

     There's now a convenient notation for this:

     : [some seq] elem ?0	# elem (pos == 0)
     : [some seq] relem ?0	# relem (pos == 0)

     Might be perhaps worth it to have this as well:

     : [some seq] @0		# elem (pos == 0)

     We could also have:
     -- slice :: ?T_SEQ ?T_CONST ?T_CONST -> ?()
     -- slice :: ?T_SEQ ?T_CONST -> ?()

     : [some seq] 1 slice	# elem (pos != 0)
     : [some seq] 3 6 slice	# elem (pos >= 3 && pos <= 5)
     : [some seq] 0 -1 slice	# relem (pos > 0)

     We would need both versions because there's no placeholder like
     None in Python, where [1:] means [1:None] and None is treated
     like one past last element.  0 can't be used in that capacity, as
     then it wouldn't be clear whether (0 0 slice) needs to yield
     nothing or everything.

***  fold :: ?T_SEQ ?() ?T_CLOSURE ->* ?()
     - This takes care of all sorts of summing and joining list
       elements.  E.g. "join" is:
       : [the sequence] "" {"%s" add} fold
       "sum" is:
       : [the sequence] 0 {add} fold

***  rfold :: ?T_SEQ ?() ?T_CLOSURE ->* ?()
     - Like fold, but works in reverse.

***  fold1 :: ?T_SEQ ?T_CLOSURE ->* ?()
     : let fold1 := {|L C| L (L elem (pos == 0)) {C} fold};
     - I.e. takes initial value from the sequence.  Produces nothing
       if the sequence is empty.

***  rfold1 :: ?T_SEQ ?T_CLOSURE ->* ?()
     - Like fold1, but in reverse order.

** ·T_CONST
***  int32_t, uint32_t, int64_t, uint64_t :: ?T_CONST -> ?T_CONST
     The idea behind uint32_t et.al. is that a two-complement
     representation of a given constant is taken, if necessary, it's
     sign-extended, and then a 32-bit or 64-bit slice of that is
     taken, and that is reinterpreted as either a signed or unsigned
     value:

     : -1 hex			# gives -0x1
     : -1 uint32_t hex		# gives 0xffffffff
     : -1 uint64_t hex		# gives 0xffffffffffffffff
     : 0xffffffff int32_t	# gives -1
     : 0xffffffffff int32_t	# gives -1 as well
     : 0xffffffff int64_t	# gives 0xffffffff

     Maybe what we want instead is "32 uint", "64 int" etc., such that
     bit length is configurable.

***  intptr_t, uintptr_t :: ?T_CONST -> ?T_CONST
     {,u}intptr_t then expands to either of {,u}int{64,32}_t depending
     on address size of CU.  XXX how to get to that size?  What
     should, say, "17 uintptr_t" do?  There's no CU in sight...

** ·T_STR
***  match :: ?T_STR ?T_STR ->* ?T_STR
     - This should work like ?match, but would produce match objects
       with individual groups.
       : "abcd" r"(\w)(\w)" ...
       : ... match			# two matches
       : ... match low			# 0 and 2
       : ... match high			# 2 and 4
       : ... match value		# "ab" and "cd"
       : ... match (pos==0) elem	# match for "a" and match for "b"
       : ... match (pos==0) elem value	# "a" and "b"

***  demangle :: ?T_STR -> ?T_STR
** ·T_CU
***  next :: ?T_CU ->? T_CU
***  prev :: ?T_CU ->? T_CU

** ·T_DIE
*** •@AT_decl_file
     Value of this attribute is represented as actual string including
     path.

     (XXX we ignore mtime and size.  Those aren't stored anyway, but
     maybe it would be useful to have them so that one can do this
     sort of querying in the first place--do we have any files where
     this is stored?  Or after it gets to be stored in general, where
     this is _not_ stored?)

***  ?LANG_* :: ?T_DIE
     Holds if (@AT_language == DW_LANG_*).

***  ?ATE_* :: ?T_DIE
     Holds if @AT_encoding == DW_ATE_*.

** ·T_ATTR
***  ?LANG_* :: ?T_ATTR
     Holds if (?AT_language value == DW_LANG_*).

***  ?ATE_* :: ?T_ATTR
     Holds if (?AT_encoding value == DW_ATE_*)

**  T_MACRO_UNIT ???
    - A value representing .debug_macro and .debug_macinfo units.
      Might be useful for DW_MACRO_GNU_transparent_include opcode, and
      for DW_AT_macro_info and DW_AT_GNU_macros attributes, which
      would hold this as a value.

***  entry :: ?T_MACRO_UNIT ->* ?T_MACRO_ENTRY
***  offset :: ?T_MACRO_UNIT ->* ?T_CONST
***  XXX :: something to get the prototype table???

**  T_MACRO_ENTRY
    - A value used for representing both .debug_macro and
      .debug_macinfo entries.  Domain of entry label disambiguates
      which is which.

***  label :: ?T_MACRO_ENTRY -> ?T_CONST
     - Opcode of this macro entry.

***  attribute :: ?T_MACRO_ENTRY ->* ?T_MACRO_ATTRIBUTE
     - Yields value(s) associated with this opcode.
     - XXX could we somehow query a form?

***  merge :: ?T_MACRO_ENTRY ->* ?T_MACRO_ENTRY
     : let merge := { ?DW_MACRO_GNU_transparent_include value };

     Should be used as with DIE's, depending on what exactly is needed
     either (merge*) or (merge* !(merge)).

***  @0, @1, ... or something???
     - Should this resemble DIE's or T_LOCLIST_OP's?  Shouldn't
       T_LOCLIST_OP's actually resemble DIE's as well?  @X as a
       shorthand for (value (pos == X)) seems fairly natural.

       If X is a name instead of a number, it means:
       : (attribute (label == X))

**  T_MACRO_ATTRIBUTE ???
    - Note that label is explicitly not applicable
***  value
***  form


* Examples
** check_die_line_info:
   : let A := entry (?TAG_subprogram, ?TAG_inlined_subroutine, ?TAG_entry_point,
   :                ?TAG_lexical_block, ?TAG_label, ?TAG_with_stmt,
   :                ?TAG_try_block, ?TAG_catch_block);
   : let B := A (@AT_entry_pc, address);
   : let C := A root address;
   : ?(B C !overlaps || B C overlap != B)
   : "Address range %( B %) referenced from %( A %)"\
   : " not fully covered by line table."

** CU A imports two PU's B and C, and both import the same third PU

   : let imports := {root child ?TAG_imported_unit @AT_import};
   :
   : let U := entry ?root ;
   : let A := U child ?TAG_imported_unit @AT_import ;
   : let B := U child ?TAG_imported_unit @AT_import (> A) ;
   : A imports B imports (== swap)
   : "PU %(offset%) is imported by PU's %(A offset%) and %(B offset%), "\
   : "which are both imported by %(U offset%)."
